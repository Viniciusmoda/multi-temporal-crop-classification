# Multi-Temporal-Crop-Classification (work-in-progress)

* Recreating code for the paper "Deep Learning Based Multi-Temporal Crop Classification"

* There are a few minor differences - Zhong et al. use 46 element vector as time series, I use MODIS NDVI data (23 entries per year).

* Paper reference: "Zhong, Liheng, Lina Hu, and Hang Zhou. "Deep learning based multi-temporal crop classification." Remote sensing of environment 221 (2019): 430-443."

* Platform: Python3, Keras, Tensorflow
